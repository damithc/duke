# Duke project template

This is a project template for a greenfield Java project. It's named after the Java mascot _Duke_. Given below are instructions on how to use it.

## Setting up in Intellij

Prerequisites: JDK 11, update Intellij to the most recent version.

1. Open Intellij (if you are not in the welcome screen, click `File` > `Close Project` to close the existing project dialog first)
1. Set up the correct JDK version, as follows:
   1. Click `Configure` > `Structure for New Projects` and then `Project Settings` > `Project` > `Project SDK`
   1. If JDK 11 is listed in the drop down, select it. If it is not, click `New...` and select the directory where you installed JDK 11
   1. Click `OK`
1. Import the project into Intellij as follows:
   1. Click `Open of Import`.
   1.**IMPORTANT: Locate the `build.gradle` file** in the project directory, select it, and click `OK`.<br>
      If asked, choose to `Open as Project` (not `Open as File`)
   1. If there are any further prompts, accept the defaults.
1. After the importing is complete, locate the `src/main/java/seedu/duke/Duke.java` file, right-click it, and choose `Run Duke.main()`. If the setup is correct, you should see something like the below:
   ```
   > Task :compileJava
   > Task :processResources NO-SOURCE
   > Task :classes
   
   > Task :Duke.main()
   Hello from
    ____        _        
   |  _ \ _   _| | _____ 
   | | | | | | | |/ / _ \
   | |_| | |_| |   <  __/
   |____/ \__,_|_|\_\___|
   
   What is your name?
   ```
   Type some word and press enter to let the execution proceed to the end.

## Build automation using Gradle
